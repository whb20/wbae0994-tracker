# FilmTrackr
## William Bae DECO2017 Web App Prototype Assessment

## DESCRIPTION
* This web application prototype is designed to help users catalog the movies they watch and analyze their film preferences.

## RATIONALE
* As the user builds their watch history, the app helps them understand trends in their preferences. The app allows the user to identify patterns to understand their unique movie tastes.

## CONFIGURATION/ACCESS INSTRUCTIONS
* This web app is deployed and hosted on a live domain via GitHub Pages and is accessible [here](https://whb20.github.io/wbae0994-tracker/).
* The web app used Parcel for development and can also be run on a Node server using Express.
* To configure/run on a local machine, install Parcel and then use the command "npm run dev" in the terminal within the root directory to set up the local server. The application can then be accessed at http://localhost:1234.

## NOTES
* The web app was developed for Desktop (1440x900) and Mobile (390x844) and will appear formatted best at those window sizes. Certain other window sizings may cause formatting problems.

## FURTHER WORK
* Users should eventually be able to edit the information for their films
* Users should eventually be able to search films within their log
* API integration of database of all films will allow users to seartch/select films instead of manually entering data
* Users should be able to create an account to access their films from multiple devices
